// churn) — StakeTransferred (transfer_stake) relocates staked alpha from one account to another on
// the same hotkey, so it moves ownership, not net capital; the sender is the origin account and the
// netuid is the origin subnet (origin leg only). Pure shaping (buildSubnetStakeTransfers) + a thin D1
// loader (loadSubnetStakeTransfers); the Worker adds the envelope. Null-safe: a cold store or a subnet
// with no StakeTransferred events yields the zeroed card.
