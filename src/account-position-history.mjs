// Per-account daily position HISTORY (block-explorer Tier-1, epic #4329/6.1).
//
// The refresh-metagraph cron lands the LATEST per-UID snapshot in `neurons`
// (overwrite-on-conflict — no history is kept). This daily rollup copies the
// current snapshot into the append-only `account_position_daily` table, keyed by
// (account, netuid, snapshot_date) instead of neuron_daily's (netuid, uid,
// snapshot_date) — giving /accounts/{addr}/portfolio's positions a per-account
// time-series (the "Alpha Holdings chart") the same way neuron_daily gives
// per-UID metagraph time-series. Same source table as neuron_daily, so both
// rollups fire from the SAME cron tick for a consistent snapshot stamp.
// account = hotkey ss58, matching loadAccountPortfolio's own "WHERE hotkey = ?"
// framing (src/account-portfolio.mjs). Pure + injectable for tests; the Worker
// runs the D1 I/O.
//
// Known overlap with neuron_daily (#4330's own issue text mandates this new
// table regardless — flagging the tradeoff here, not silently accepting or
// re-litigating it): every column this table stores already exists in
// neuron_daily, which already carries a `hotkey` column and a purpose-built
// `idx_neuron_daily_hotkey_date` index ("Point-in-time account history: which
// UID a hotkey held on a date" — migrations/0011_neuron_daily.sql) that could
// serve most of this same read pattern (`WHERE hotkey = ? ORDER BY
// snapshot_date`) with no new table. This rollup doubles daily write volume
// onto the same D1 database that has already hit its capacity limit once
// (neuron_daily's own 400d->90d retention cut, src/neuron-history.mjs) — worth
// weighing before #4331's read route builds on top of this table, and before
// assuming this data couldn't instead be served from neuron_daily directly.
//
// Known scope limitation: "position"/stake_tao here is a HOTKEY's own
// registered-neuron stake (for a validator hotkey, the FULL pool delegated to
// it by every nominator — migrations/0007_neurons.sql's stake_tao comment),
// not a coldkey's aggregate nominator/delegated stake across OTHER people's
// validators. A wallet that only delegates (never registers its own hotkey)
// will show near-zero history here despite genuinely holding alpha — that
// delegated-stake concept only exists as an account_events log today (would
// need balance reconstruction, out of scope for this issue). Matches
// loadAccountPortfolio's existing, equally-unqualified "WHERE hotkey = ?"
// framing (src/account-portfolio.mjs) — not a new gap, but worth restating
// here since epic #4329 explicitly frames this as taostats.io's (coldkey-
// centric) "Alpha Holdings" feature.
