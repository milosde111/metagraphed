// Subnet-lease lifecycle history (#6719, part of the subnet-leasing/
// crowdloan-tracking epic #6717): every SubnetLeaseCreated /
// SubnetLeaseTerminated event this subnet has had, decoded from the
// account_events stream #6718 started capturing. Pure shaping over RAW
// account_events rows -- mirrors src/subnet-ownership-history.mjs's own
// "one row in, one record out" convention.
//
// SubnetLeaseDividendsDistributed / Contributed / Withdrew are deliberately
// EXCLUDED here even though #6718 captures all five kinds: none of those
// three carry a netuid on their account_events row, and
// deploy/postgres/schema.sql's account_events table has no lease_id column
// to join back through either -- SubnetLeaseDividendsDistributed's own
// on-chain event is only {lease_id, contributor, alpha} (no netuid), and
// Contributed/Withdrew are Crowdloan-pallet events keyed by crowdloan_id,
// emitted before any subnet/netuid exists for the crowdloan being funded.
// A netuid-scoped history can only show the two lifecycle events that are
// actually netuid-tagged at the point they're emitted (verified against
// the pallet source, pallets/subtensor/src/subnets/leasing.rs: SubnetLease-
// Created carries {beneficiary, lease_id, netuid, end_block},
// SubnetLeaseTerminated carries {beneficiary, netuid} -- both netuid-
// tagged; SubnetLeaseDividendsDistributed carries {lease_id, contributor,
// alpha} -- no netuid).
