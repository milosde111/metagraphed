# Metagraphed Submission Gate

Metagraphed accepts community registry improvements through a public preflight
contract and a private review gate.

The public repo intentionally contains only deterministic validation, issue/PR
templates, broad labels, and safe reason categories. Private scoring prompts,
thresholds, corpus weights, and merge heuristics stay outside the public repo so
the gate is harder to game.

## Public States

- `submit_pr`: the submission shape is valid and ready for private review.
- `fix_required`: the submission is malformed, unsafe, duplicate, or out of
  scope.
- `route_away`: the PR is not a direct UGC submission and should use normal
  backend review.
- `manual_review`: the submission may be useful but needs human judgment.

## Labels

- `metagraphed-under-review`: the gate accepted the item for review.
- `metagraphed-manual-review`: the item needs human judgment.
- `metagraphed-closed-by-gate`: the gate closed a hard failure.
- `metagraphed-merged-by-gate`: the gate merged or imported a passing item.
- `metagraphed-import-approved`: an issue submission can open an import PR.

The stable marker comment is:

```html
<!-- metagraphed-submission-gate -->
```

## Direct PR Shape

Direct UGC PRs must change exactly one candidate or provider review file:

```text
registry/candidates/community/<slug>.json
registry/providers/community/<slug>.json
```

The file must contain exactly one candidate:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "submission": {
    "submitted_by": "github-login",
    "submitted_by_url": "https://github.com/github-login"
  },
  "candidates": [
    {
      "schema_version": 1,
      "id": "community-sn-7-docs-example",
      "netuid": 7,
      "state": "schema-valid",
      "name": "Allways community docs example",
      "kind": "docs",
      "url": "https://docs.example.com",
      "source_url": "https://github.com/example/project",
      "source_urls": ["https://github.com/example/project"],
      "source_type": "community-pr-intake",
      "source_tier": "community-docs",
      "confidence": "medium",
      "provider": "community",
      "auth_required": false,
      "public_safe": true,
      "rate_limit_notes": "",
      "review_notes": "Community-submitted public interface candidate."
    }
  ]
}
```

Provider profile review files must contain exactly one provider profile:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "submission": {
    "submitted_by": "github-login",
    "submitted_by_url": "https://github.com/github-login"
  },
  "provider": {
    "schema_version": 1,
    "id": "example-operator",
    "name": "Example Operator",
    "kind": "infrastructure-provider",
    "website_url": "https://example.com",
    "docs_url": "https://docs.example.com",
    "github_url": "https://github.com/example",
    "contact_url": "https://example.com/contact",
    "authority": "community",
    "public_notes": "Public-safe provider profile submission."
  }
}
```

Generated artifacts, scripts, workflows, package metadata, native snapshots,
private URLs, secrets, wallet/PAT data, and validator-local data are rejected.
Provider profile submissions are review inputs only; they cannot claim official
authority, directly modify canonical provider manifests, set endpoint health, or
make any endpoint pool-eligible.

## Supported UGC Types

The public gate accepts or routes:

- subnet interface additions and corrections;
- endpoint resource submissions for `subtensor-rpc`, `subtensor-wss`,
  `archive`, `subnet-api`, `openapi`, `sse`, `data-artifact`, `dashboard`,
  `docs`, `website`, `source-repo`, `sdk`, and `example`;
- provider/operator profile submissions;
- endpoint status reports;
- auth and rate-limit metadata corrections;
- adapter requests and evidence/provenance corrections.

Base-layer RPC/WSS/archive claims, unknown providers, authenticated APIs,
adapter requests, and conflicting source claims route to manual/private review.

Endpoint and status submissions can create candidates, reports, or re-probe
work. They cannot directly set observed uptime, latency, status, health class,
or pool eligibility; those values are generated only from Metagraphed probes and
adapter checks.

## Private Gate Runtime

The private `metagraphed-submission-gate` should run on Cloudflare:

- Worker for GitHub App webhooks and protected queue/status routes.
- D1 for PR/issue state, verdicts, retry state, idempotency keys, and audit
  rows.
- R2 for redacted webhook payloads, probe evidence, and private review reports.
- Queues plus a dead-letter queue for async review jobs.
- Scheduled sweeper for stuck `validation_pending`, `merge_pending`, and
  retryable rows.

The public workflow job `metagraphed-submission-gate` only runs deterministic
preflight. It must not publish, merge, or expose private review details.

Production GitHub writes must use a GitHub App installation token. A fallback
`GITHUB_TOKEN` can exist for emergency/local testing only when the private
runtime explicitly enables `METAGRAPH_GATE_ALLOW_GITHUB_TOKEN_FALLBACK=true`.
Fallback-token mode is not production-ready because it is easier to rate-limit
and does not prove the app installation path works.

The private health endpoint exposes public-safe readiness fields:

- `github_app_configured`: true only when `GITHUB_APP_ID` and
  `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` are installed.
- `github_write_mode`: `github-app`, `fallback-token`, or `missing`.
- `production_ready`: true only when the required runtime pieces are present.
- `production_blockers`: broad blocker categories such as
  `github_app_credentials_missing`.

Operators can verify the public-safe readiness contract with:

```bash
npm run submission-gate:health
```

During setup, use this non-blocking form to inspect current blockers without
treating them as a passing production gate:

```bash
npm run submission-gate:health -- --allow-non-production
```

## Discord Notifications

Discord delivery belongs to the private Cloudflare gate runtime, not GitHub
Actions. The public repo only documents the contract and validates that secrets
and private reviewer internals are not tracked.

V1 sends one notification for terminal UGC decisions only:

- `merged`: the gate merged a clean direct PR or imported an approved issue.
- `closed`: the gate closed a hard failure.
- `manual-review`: the gate persisted a manual-review decision.
- `retry-exhausted`: automation stopped after retryable reviewer or platform
  failures exceeded the retry budget.

The gate should not notify for `route_away`, `submit_pr`, `fix_required`, or
normal backend/code PRs.

The Worker stores a `last_notification_key` in D1. The key must include the
target, PR head SHA or issue revision, terminal status, and verdict. Repeated
queue retries for the same head or issue revision must not send duplicate
Discord messages; a new PR head or edited issue revision may send a new terminal
notification.

The Discord webhook is configured only as a Worker secret:

```bash
wrangler secret put DISCORD_SUBMISSION_WEBHOOK_URL
```

Other private gate secrets are also Worker secrets:

- `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- `GITHUB_APP_ID`
- `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `INTERNAL_SHARED_SECRET`
- `PRIVATE_GATE_REVIEW_URL`
- private reviewer service credentials, if used

Discord embeds must be compact and public-safe. They can include the result,
netuid, interface kind, submitter, source URL, GitHub URL, and a short AI
rationale. They must strip marker comments, webhook URLs, wallet/PAT-like text,
private AI prompts, private scoring thresholds, corpus weights, and provider
model details.
