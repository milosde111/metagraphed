# Metagraphed Backend Operations

## Source Of Truth

GitHub-reviewed registry source, compact generated indexes, and compact release manifests are canonical for v1. High-churn generated detail is staged under `dist/metagraph-r2/metagraph` and published to R2; Cloudflare serves and stores artifacts, but it does not become the registry truth source.

## Routine Validation

```bash
npm run pipeline:check
```

This performs dry-run sync/discovery/verification, contract validation, Worker runtime checks, workflow validation, public-safety scanning, and tests.

The contract checks include schema bundle drift, schema/query enum parity, OpenAPI example validation, generated TypeScript freshness, and generated client freshness.

## Operator Briefs

Contributor curation:

```bash
npm run curation:brief
```

Endpoint operations:

```bash
npm run endpoint:brief
```

The endpoint brief summarizes monitored resources, root RPC/WSS/archive advisory pools, provider scores, incidents, and the disabled proxy contract from existing artifacts. Health, latency, latest block, incidents, and pool eligibility remain probe-derived only.

## Refreshing Artifacts

```bash
npm run pipeline:refresh
```

This updates native subnet data, candidates, verification, baseline curation, adapter snapshots, generated artifacts, schema snapshots, R2 manifest, and validation outputs.

The refresh keeps Git reviewable: compact artifacts remain in `public/metagraph`, while per-subnet candidates, verification details, health detail/history, adapter snapshots, schema snapshots, and provider detail outputs are staged for R2 and should not be committed.

Candidate discovery reads public enrichment sources such as TaoMarketCap,
Backprop Finance dashboard routes, Taostats metagraph dashboard routes,
Tensorplex `subnet-docs`, and Taopedia articles. Set `GITHUB_TOKEN` or
`GH_TOKEN` for authenticated read-only GitHub API requests during local
refreshes; scheduled sync and publish workflows already pass `GITHUB_TOKEN`
from GitHub Actions.

Live health probes are only written when explicitly enabled:

```bash
METAGRAPH_WRITE_PROBE_RESULTS=1 npm run pipeline:refresh
```

## Cloudflare Publish

The `Publish Cloudflare Backend` workflow is fail-closed for `main` pushes:
`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` must be configured as
GitHub Actions secrets or the publish run fails before any upload/deploy step.
Manual `workflow_dispatch` runs can choose `publish_mode=dry-run` for
validation-only checks; dry-run mode must not upload to R2, publish KV, deploy
the Worker, or claim a production publish.

Before publishing:

```bash
npm run cloudflare:verify:dry-run
npm run r2:upload:dry-run
npm run kv:publish:dry-run
npm run worker:deploy:dry-run
```

Actual writes require explicit environment gates:

- `METAGRAPH_ALLOW_R2_UPLOAD=1`
- `METAGRAPH_R2_UPLOAD_HISTORY=1` when the publish job should also write run-prefix history copies for changed artifacts and control files.
- `METAGRAPH_R2_UPLOAD_FORCE=1` when a publish job should ignore the remote `latest/r2-manifest.json` comparison and republish every planned artifact.
- `METAGRAPH_R2_UPLOAD_LIMIT` for smoke-only uploads against a small artifact subset. Limited smoke uploads skip control files so `latest/r2-manifest.json` continues to describe only a complete latest artifact set.
- `METAGRAPH_ALLOW_KV_WRITE=1`
- `METAGRAPH_KV_NAMESPACE_ID`
- Cloudflare account/API credentials

Normal R2 publishes are delta-based. The uploader reads `latest/r2-manifest.json`, compares artifact SHA-256 values, reads R2-tier files from the staging tree, skips unchanged artifact files, and refreshes `latest/r2-manifest.json` plus `latest/build-summary.json` on full uploads so Worker fallback and operator summaries stay current.

After the Worker is deployed, run the live smoke gate:

```bash
npm run smoke:live
```

The live smoke checks `metagraph.sh` API envelopes, Worker-mediated raw artifact routes, CORS/cache headers, R2-backed detail routes, invalid-query errors, and verifies the v1 RPC proxy still returns `rpc_proxy_disabled`.

## Restore From R2

Dry-run:

```bash
npm run r2:download:dry-run
```

Write mode verifies downloaded SHA-256 hashes against `public/metagraph/r2-manifest.json`.

```bash
METAGRAPH_ALLOW_R2_DOWNLOAD=1 npm run r2:download
```

## Rollback

Rollback is pointer-first:

- point KV `metagraph:latest` at a known-good R2 run prefix;
- verify `/api/v1/build`, `/api/v1/contracts`, `/api/v1/health`, `/api/v1/endpoint-pools`, and `/api/v1/rpc/pools`;
- disable `METAGRAPH_ENABLE_RPC_PROXY` immediately if proxy behavior is suspect.

## Known Non-Blocking Drift

`sync:subnets:dry-run` can report chain metadata changes, such as subnet names. These should become reviewed sync PRs, not silent direct pushes.
