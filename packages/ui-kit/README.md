# @jsonbored/ui-kit

Internal design-system component library for `apps/ui` — extracted into a real, buildable
package instead of living directly inside the app's `src/`. Not published to npm; consumed by
`apps/ui` as an npm workspace link.

Why this package exists: [#4867](https://github.com/JSONbored/metagraphed/issues/4867).

## Status

Design tokens, the shadcn-style `components/ui/*` primitives, the cross-cutting visual-language
components, and the chart primitives have all migrated
([#4861](https://github.com/JSONbored/metagraphed/issues/4861)-[#4864](https://github.com/JSONbored/metagraphed/issues/4864)).
`apps/ui` consumes everything from `@jsonbored/ui-kit`.

## Boundary rule: no app-specific imports

This package must stay a real, standalone, dependency-free library — the moment a component here
imports something app-specific, the extraction has silently regressed back into the exact problem
this package exists to fix. `eslint.config.js`'s `no-restricted-imports` rule enforces this in CI:
importing `@tanstack/react-router`, `@tanstack/react-query`, or anything resolving into
`apps/ui/**` fails the build. If a component genuinely needs routing/data, accept it as a prop
from the caller instead. If it needs a small pure helper that also lives in `apps/ui` (date
formatting, a `cn()`-style className joiner, etc.), duplicate the specific pieces needed rather
than importing across the package boundary — see `src/lib/format.ts` for the established pattern.

## Build

```sh
npm run build --workspace=packages/ui-kit
```

Emits `dist/index.js` (ESM), `dist/index.cjs` (CJS), `dist/index.d.ts` (types), and
`dist/index.css` (extracted CSS, exported publicly as `@jsonbored/ui-kit/styles.css`) via
`tsup`. `dist/index.{js,cjs,css}` are committed (see `.gitignore`'s comment for why);
`.d.ts`/`.d.cts` are built fresh, not committed.
