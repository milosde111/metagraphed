// #4909 D1 retirement: the "happy path" describe block that used to live here
// exercised the D1-served account_events query directly (a capturing D1 stub +
// handleSubnetStakeTransfers). account_events' D1 write path is retired
// (#4772) and the table is dropped in production, so that query no longer
// runs at all — handleSubnetStakeTransfers now only calls tryPostgresTier,
// falling back to a schema-stable-empty buildSubnetStakeTransfers(null, ...)
// literal on a miss, never D1. Only the pure cache-key coverage below
// (canonicalSubnetStakeTransfersCachePath, untouched by the retirement)
// remains meaningful here.
