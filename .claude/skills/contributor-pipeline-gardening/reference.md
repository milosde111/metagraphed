# Contributor pipeline gardening — reference (metagraphed)

## Scope boundary — registry enrichment is a separate automation (see SKILL.md)

Don't file, triage, or fix anything under `registry/subnets/*.json` from this pipeline — not just the
Enrich-SNxx new-subnet-intake family, but registry data work of any kind (accuracy passes,
probe-config gaps, curation fields, etc). See SKILL.md's "Scope boundary" section for the 2026-07-19
incident that established this.

## Docs architecture migration — RESOLVED 2026-07-16, fully shipped

metagraphed's website docs migrated off hand-built TanStack Router route files (one full React
component per page — the old `docs.*.tsx` pattern) onto a shared MDX pipeline. **#6225** (the port
issue, filed 2026-07-16 after loopover's own spike/rollout — JSONbored/loopover#6037 + #6271) closed
the same day as **superseded**: the pipeline shipped via a native `fumadocs-mdx` + `fumadocs-ui` +
`fumadocs-openapi` integration (not the originally-proposed Scalar `@scalar/api-reference`) — content
now lives in `content/docs/*.mdx` behind a single `docs.$.tsx` catch-all route, and the API-reference
half is generated straight from `openapi.json` via `fumadocs-openapi` (#6210) rather than an embedded
Scalar component.

**All 10 previously-paused "Docs page: X" issues (#3504-#3511, #3514, #3516) plus the earlier
#3512/#3513/#3515 are written and closed (#6232).** This family is fully drained — don't look here
for Pass 2 top-up material, and don't re-open or re-triage any of these issues; they're done.

## Product shape

metagraphed is a Bittensor subnet registry + block-explorer product: `registry/subnets/<slug>.json`
(one file per subnet, community-contributed surfaces), a Worker API (`workers/`, OpenAPI-schema-driven,
`schemas/` is the contract), and `apps/ui` (the explorer frontend). See `.claude/skills/metagraphed/`
for the full contribution model — that skill is authoritative for how a PR gets merged here; this
skill only covers issue-pipeline hygiene, not PR review mechanics.

## Milestone taxonomy (re-check every run — this repo's hygiene and counts drift faster than gittensory's)

| Milestone                                     | Open (as of 2026-07-15)                                                                  | Nature                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Also the default home for well-precedented REST/GraphQL/MCP parity issues (no dedicated milestone exists for that pattern yet).                                                                                                 |

**Every gardening-generated issue gets a milestone — none ship unmilestoned** (reinforced by the
maintainer, 2026-07-15). Default to the closest-fitting existing one from the table above. A new
milestone is warranted only when nothing existing fits AND the work is either a genuinely major
initiative or a recurring category that will keep needing a home — see gittensory/loopover's own
`reference.md` for the `Miner Wave 4.5` precedent of the latter case. A one-off oddity alone isn't
enough justification; when genuinely unsure on a high-stakes call like this, propose 1-2 options, but
default to deciding and documenting the reasoning rather than blocking a run on confirmation.

## Labels — this repo's own convention, don't force gittensory's onto it

- `gittensor:bug` (0.05x), `gittensor:feature` (0.25x), `gittensor:priority` (1.5x) — same point
  values as gittensory, **but `gittensor:priority` is used far more liberally here** (roughly a third
  of all open issues, often standalone with no `gittensor:feature`/`gittensor:bug` pairing). Follow
  this repo's existing density, don't artificially scarce it down to match gittensory.
- `help wanted` — paired with points labels, same as gittensory.
- `backend` / `frontend` — apply when the work is clearly one or the other; skip when it's genuinely
  both or neither (e.g. a pure docs/data issue).
- `maintainer-only` — used on ~57% of open issues (81/142). Only ~14 of those also carry `roadmap`,
  so **don't assume the `roadmap`+`maintainer-only` pairing convention from gittensory applies here**
  — in this repo `maintainer-only` alone is a complete, sufficient signal.
- `good first issue` is **not** a real convention here — the label doesn't exist in this repo
  (confirmed 2026-07-14) and the maintainer doesn't want it added. Only `gittensor:*` + `help wanted`
  (+ `backend`/`frontend` where clearly applicable) matter for contributor-available issues.
- Never add anything beyond the above to a gardening-generated issue.

## What's safe to unleash

Same underlying test as gittensory's copy of this skill (clear precedent to follow, no business/product
decision required, doesn't touch security-sensitive surfaces without a maintainer design pass first,
doesn't require access a contributor can't have). metagraphed-specific instances of the boundary:

- **Docs pages for already-shipped API endpoints** (the Wave 4 "Docs page: X" family) — writing
  accurate docs for an existing, stable endpoint is mechanical and low-risk. Good unlock candidates.
- **Native-staking feature work** (real stake movement, commission/take management, re-delegation,
  the pre-launch security review, phishing-resistance/subdomain work) — stays `maintainer-only`.
  This is live financial functionality; don't unlock any of it without an explicit ask.
- **Registry/surface data contributions** are a distinct category from code issues — they're the
  community's main contribution path (one file per subnet) and don't need the same
  maintainer-vs-contributor gating a code change does, since the gate's own AI-reviewer +
  ownership-proof verification is the real safety net there, not issue labeling.

## Issue body template

```md
## Context

<what exists today, cite real file/schema/route paths, why this matters>

## Requirements

<concrete, testable requirements>

## Deliverables

- [ ] <concrete artifact 1>
- [ ] <concrete artifact 2>

## Expected Outcome

<what's true after this ships that wasn't true before>

## Links & Resources

<related issues, files to anchor on>
```

For a registry/surface-data issue (asking a contributor to add a subnet's surfaces), follow the
surface-contribution shape in `.claude/skills/metagraphed/reference.md` instead — do not use the
code-issue template above for that kind of ask.

## Native relationship linking (GraphQL — confirmed available on this repo, 2026-07-14)

**Check every new batch of issues for a real dependency before moving on — required, not optional**
(reinforced by the maintainer, 2026-07-15). Most batches of independent bug-fixes or parity additions
(e.g. a set of REST/GraphQL-mirror issues, each adding one unrelated field) genuinely have no
dependency on each other — the correct outcome of the check is then "no links needed." Reserve
`addBlockedBy` for a real case where working an issue out of order would waste a contributor's time,
and `addSubIssue` for anything genuinely part of a parent epic/tracker.

```graphql
mutation {
  addSubIssue(
    input: { issueId: "<parent node id>", subIssueId: "<child node id>" }
  ) {
    issue {
      number
    }
  }
}
mutation {
  addBlockedBy(
    input: {
      issueId: "<blocked node id>"
      blockingIssueId: "<blocker node id>"
    }
  ) {
    issue {
      number
    }
  }
}
```

**Field name gotcha:** the mutation's second input field is `blockingIssueId`, not `blockedById` —
`blockedById` fails with `argumentNotAccepted`. Confirmed live 2026-07-16 linking #3504-3511/3514/3516
as blocked by #6225.

Get a node ID: `gh api graphql -f query='query { repository(owner:"JSONbored", name:"metagraphed") { issue(number: N) { id } } }'`.

## gh CLI gotchas

- `gh api graphql -f query=@file.txt` does **not** read the file — `-f` treats `@file` as a literal
  string and the request fails with a GraphQL parse error on the `@`. Use **`-F query=@file.txt`**
  (capital F) whenever the query is large enough to be worth writing to a file first.
- `gh issue close` has no `--comment-file` flag — write the comment to a file, then pass
  `-c "$(cat file.md)"` (double-quoted around the whole substitution) so any backticks in the comment
  text are treated as literal characters, not re-parsed by bash as command substitution.
- Never embed a body/comment string containing backticks directly inside a `python3 -c "..."`
  double-quoted bash argument for the same reason — write it to a file first.
